## 27. May: Start of the project
Yesterday i started thinking about this project. I was searching the web for suitable RP and settled on RP Zero 2W. It should have enought power to run some games on RetroPie. I chose the zero 2W, becouse it is really small. That is usefull because i am making handheld.

Today I started searching the web for other parts.

I will need:

- Display
    
- Some way to get audio
    
- ~~Switches or keys~~ Nintendo DS Lite pads
    
- battery and charging module.
 
 First i started looking for display. I wanted somethig between 4" and 6". I was thinking about [this one](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B085TC5YMR?ref=myi_title_dp&th=1) or [this one](https://tinyurl.com/ev4p9sd7), but they were to small. Than I found this [5" display](https://tinyurl.com/3287bkxc). Downside on this one is that it uses HDMI and not the pins on the RP.

 Than I started to think about the audio. There are three ways I can get it from RP0.
 
1. Buy cheap USB dongle
    
2. Buy [premade DAC HAT for RP](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/audio-amp-shim-3w-mono-amp?variant=32341591064659)
    
3. Make my own audio output system with help of [tutorial](https://youtu.be/3pXB90IDNoY?si=AYgq76n8aVKT-kv3)
    
I was thinkig about the second option, but than I said to myself that It would be to easy :D. I will need:

- 2x 270 Ohm resistors
- 2x 150 Ohm resistors
- 2x 10 uf electrolitic Capacitors
- 2x 0.01 uf Polyester -Fil Capacitors
- audio jack
- custom PCB

**Time spent: 3hr**
