## 27th May: Start of the project
Yesterday i started thinking about this project. I was searching the web for suitable RP and settled on RP Zero 2W. It should have enought power to run some games on RetroPie. I chose the zero 2W, becouse it is really small. That is usefull because i am making handheld.

Today I started searching the web for other parts.

I will need:

- Screen
    
- Some way to get audio
    
- Inputs
    
- Battery and charging module.

 ### Screen
 First i started looking for display. I wanted somethig between 4" and 6". I was thinking about [this one](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B085TC5YMR?ref=myi_title_dp&th=1) or [this one](https://tinyurl.com/ev4p9sd7), but they were to small. Than I found this [5" display](https://tinyurl.com/3287bkxc) (the touch variant for easier manipulation). Downside on this one is that it uses HDMI and not the pins on the RP.

### Audio
 Than I started to think about the audio. There are three ways I can get it from RP0.
 
1. Buy cheap USB dongle
    
2. Buy [premade DAC HAT for RP](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/audio-amp-shim-3w-mono-amp?variant=32341591064659)
    
3. Make my own audio output system with help of [tutorial](https://youtu.be/3pXB90IDNoY?si=AYgq76n8aVKT-kv3)
    
I was thinkig about the second option, but than I said to myself that It would be to easy :D. I will need:

- 2x [270 Ohm resistors](https://tinyurl.com/ycs5rh84)
- 2x [150 Ohm resistors](https://tinyurl.com/ycs5rh84)
- 2x [10 uf electrolitic Capacitors](https://tinyurl.com/2p6z8e5f)
- 2x [0.01 uf Polyester-Film Capacitors](https://tinyurl.com/33zae35e)
- [Speaker](https://tinyurl.com/4ueak527)
- custom PCB

Here is schematic of how it should be connected

### Inputs
I looked into how game controllers work. I found this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/8lt9gv/what_kind_of_pushbuttons_do_game_controllers_use/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and through the comments I found [those switches](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32866761020.html). They are rubber dome switches, you could find something similar in membrane keyboards. Thay will be conected by [wire](https://tinyurl.com/4vmrkypu). I wanted to make PCB for them, but that would be harder to attach it to the case...

### Battery and charging module
With the help of this [video](https://youtu.be/wPQf_Pz0APA?si=iIAJfkxdQpS1blh7) I learned how to charge the RP0 from battery. ~~I found [cheap voltage booster](https://tinyurl.com/429w3p3t), because the one he uses in the video is almost 15x more expensive.~~ I also found this [battery](https://tinyurl.com/25jmx5w2). Because I don't want to have the RP0 take the power all the time I also found those [switches](https://tinyurl.com/34hr93tu).

**Time spent: 5hr**

## 28th May: PCB and batteries

### Battery and charging module 
I found out that the vlotage booster i found yesterday doesn't suport charging... So I found [new one](https://tinyurl.com/4jvbk29v) that does. I wil also need some [USB-C inupt with cables](https://tinyurl.com/2bktbsuc). Because i also want to know how charged the battery is i will need [battery charge indicator](https://tinyurl.com/5596b6uh).

This is how it will look like:

### PCB
I started working on the PCB for my project. I found this [footprint](https://www.snapeda.com/parts/RASPBERRY%20PI%20ZERO%202%20W/Raspberry%20Pi/view-part/) of RP0 that I'll use.

I started working on the schematic, and created this:


<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7131816d-9086-4aaf-9e25-67b31e1ef72d" alt="image" width="600"/>

I had lots of problems with finding the right footprints for the resistors and capacitors...

After some time I finished the PCB

### Audio
I found parts (resistors, capacitors, etc.) and added the links to the list above.

**Time spent: 5.5hr**

## 29th May: Remaking the PCB

### PCB
Today I relised the pcb is to big, so i started remaking it... I reduced it a lot.

Height: 97mm -> 69mm

Width: 88mm -> 70mm

Here is the new version of the pcb:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ed13aef-1bf1-43a1-a037-ff171e0d801e" alt="image" width="600"/>

### Case
I also started working on the case.
Here is drawing of the layout of the case:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/835690f5-43f3-4c0c-b03c-64ec0d341f9e" alt="image" width="600"/>

I realised that It will be huge even after the PCB edit, so I'm thinking about renaming it "GameBoy Pro Max" :D

With help of the scatch above I managed to create model of the bottom case.

And than I started to work on the top part. It is still without button holes, but that will wait...

**Time spent: 3.5hr**

## 2nd June: Small Case edit
Today, I spent some more time on the case. I  created holes for the buttons. They are 10mm wide, they are 10mm apart as you can see on the second image...

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daedccb8-db24-4e91-900a-d5dc701e6dfa" alt="image" width="600"/>

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd2969b9-0dc7-4834-997e-9043742ec40c" alt="image" width="600"/>

I din't have much time today, so I hope I will make more progress tomorow.

**Time spent: 0.4hr**

## 3rd June: Finishing case and software 
### Case
I created small part that will hold buttons. It will be hot glued together...

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73910abe-4628-49af-8c79-f597c4ee4465" alt="image" width="600"/>

This is how it will work:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/664cb555-08ad-40a6-a7b1-2bbbb6a56652" alt="image" width="600"/>

I also created buttons
- Base radius: 12 mm
- Base height: 2 mm
- Radius: 9 mm
- Height: 10mm

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1035b1b4-809c-4043-b05a-d48d13b27417" alt="image" width="600"/>

### Software
I also started working on software. I crearted instructions on how to change files to have working sound. It is located in Software folder...

I also foud this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV_nVu8Be7M) that will help me to use my buttons as inputs.

I started asigning the buttons to the GPIO pins
